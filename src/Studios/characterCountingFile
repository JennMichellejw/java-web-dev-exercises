Parameters: This method accepts two parameters:

key: which is the key of the element whose value has to be replaced.
value: which is the new value which has to be mapped with the provided key.
Return Value: This method returns the previous value associated with the specified key. If there is no such key mapped, then it returns null, if the implementation supports null value.

IllegalArgumentException if some property of the specified key or value prevents it from being stored in this map.
